# <a name="s1"></a>fakepayment

You are given several Java interfaces for a fake payment system.  Your task is to implement the system.

----

# <a name="s2"></a>The basic rules are :

1. No two users can have the same e-mail address.  The e-mail address uniquely identifies each user in the system. <br/>
2. Accounts can be shared by multiple users but a user can only be linked to 1 account ( for the sake of simplicity ). <br/>
3. You cannot modify any of the interfaces but you are free to add whatever methods you want to your implementation classes. <br/>

----

# <a name="s3"></a>Must :
- You must document the API with swagger.
- You must implement unit test and integration test if needed.
- Will be a plus if you use any database.
- Will be a plus if you deploy the application in a cloud.
- Will be a plus if you deliver a postman collection to consume the API.

----

# <a name="s4"></a>How to deliver it?
In the next following 3-4 days after to receive this challenge you will have to push your code into a personal repository of GitHub, GitLab or somethig similar and send the link.

Take in consideration it will be evaluated given the code quality and delivery time.
